# Mini-hacker news

Your task is to recreate the front page of [Hacker News](news.ycombinator.com)!

Hacker News has an official API, documented [here](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). We'd like you to make a small AngularJS project which talks to this API to display the top 30 stories, along with their links, score, submitter, and number of comments.

You're welcome to style the page as you like - you don't need to be totally faithful to the original, be creative! We're only interested in the main page - you don't need to worry about logging in/out, the functionality of the header, having comment pages, etc. The only restriction is we'd like you to write all the style yourself; please no UI libraries (Bootstrap, etc).

Please submit your code via a link to a git repo (either on Github or Bitbucket, if you'd prefer to keep it private).
You can set up the project however you like, including from scratch, but you may find using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) with an Angular generator saves you some time setting up the project itself.* Other approaches are encouraged as well, just make sure to include set-up and run instructions (if necessary!)

If you have any questions, please contact dan@katchup.com.

*We've also attached a .zip file of the output of a Yeoman generator; it caused some problems in the office! We're really not so worried about the set up of the project, so if you have any troubles getting your environment ready, please get in touch.
